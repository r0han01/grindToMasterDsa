## 🧠 Grind To Master Data Structures & Algorithms  
*A personal journey of learning, practicing, and mastering Data Structures & Algorithms with Python.*

---

Welcome to my curated collection of **LeetCode** solutions written in **Python**.  
This repository documents my ongoing journey to strengthen problem-solving skills and master **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** — guided by structured learning from **TuteDude’s “DSA with Python”** course.

## Repository Structure

Each module will have its dedicated directory containing:

- Python solutions to relevant problems.
- Detailed explanations and comments for clarity.
- Additional resources or notes as needed.

## Acknowledgments

While working on these problems, I occasionally utilize tools like ChatGPT, Grok, and DeepSeek for guidance and to enhance my understanding. These tools assist in clarifying concepts, debugging, and exploring alternative solutions.

## 📚 Learning Pathway Recommendation (For Tutedude DSA Learners)

If you are following the DSA course from **Tutedude**, I highly recommend using this roadmap for a structured and professional learning journey:

### 🚀 Step-by-Step Learning Roadmap

1. **Master Python Basics**  
   - Focus on flowcharts, variables, conditionals, loops, recursion, lists, strings, and dictionaries.
   - Solve ~30 Easy problems on LeetCode (`Array`, `String`, `Math` tags).

2. **Crack Array, String, and Sorting Algorithms**  
   - Learn patterns like Kadane’s Algorithm, 2SUM/3SUM, KMP, QuickSort, MergeSort.
   - Solve ~50 Easy/Medium LeetCode problems (`Sliding Window`, `Two Pointers`, `Sorting` tags).

3. **Understand OOPS Concepts**  
   - Constructors, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Dunder Methods.
   - Practice basic `Design` problems like LRU Cache, Min Stack.

4. **Master Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues**  
   - Implement them manually.
   - Solve ~30–40 problems (e.g., Reverse Linked List, Cycle Detection, Trapping Rainwater).

5. **Deep Dive into Trees and Heaps**  
   - Focus on Traversals, Views, Construction, BSTs, and Heap operations.
   - Solve ~50 problems (`Tree`, `BST`, `Heap` tags).

6. **Conquer Graph Algorithms**  
   - DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Floyd-Warshall, Topological Sort.
   - Solve ~40–50 graph problems (`Graph`, `Union Find`, `Shortest Path`).

7. **Learn Greedy, Backtracking, and Dynamic Programming**  
   - Solve major optimization problems (e.g., N-Queens, Knapsack, Coin Change, Longest Subsequence).

8. **Strengthen Number Theory Basics**  
   - Sieve of Eratosthenes, GCD, Modular Arithmetic, Binary Exponentiation.

### 🏆 Final Goal
- Solve 300–500 problems across different topics.
- Focus daily on 1 Easy + 1 Medium problem for consistency.
- Gradually move into solving `Hard` problems once you're comfortable.

---
> 🔥 Tip: Always understand the **concept first**, then practice a few **pattern-based problems** before moving ahead. Depth > Speed.

Happy Learning and All the Best! 🚀
